Based on the requirements provided, here is the proposed architecture for the project:

1. `main.py`: The entrypoint file that handles the backend logic and serves the website.
2. `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the website.
3. `static/style.css`: The CSS file for styling the website.
4. `static/script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling user inputs and interacting with the backend.

Now let's go through each file and provide the code for each one.

`main.py`
